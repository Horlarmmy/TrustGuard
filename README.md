# 🔒 TrustGuard: AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditing and Wallet Reputation Scoring

## 📖 Introduction
TrustGuard is an advanced tooling solution designed to enhance the security and trustworthiness of smart contracts and blockchain participants. Leveraging **Google Generative AI**, TrustGuard analyzes smart contracts to identify vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, gas inefficiencies, and access control flaws. It also aggregates on-chain data from explorers like **Etherscan**, **Polygonscan**, and **BscScan** to generate a comprehensive wallet reputation score ranging from -100 to 100.

By fusing **AI-powered auditing** with **blockchain-based reputation scoring**, TrustGuard empowers developers, investors, and protocols to build and participate in a safer and more transparent Web3 ecosystem.

## 🛠 Implementation

1. **Data Collection** 🔍  
   - Fetch smart contract source code from block explorers (e.g., Etherscan, Polygonscan, BscScan).  
   - Retrieve wallet transaction data via blockchain APIs.

2. **AI Analysis** 🤖  
   - Utilize **Google Generative AI** to analyze smart contracts and provide actionable fixes.  
   - Leverage natural language processing (NLP) to offer contextual explanations and recommendations.

3. **Reputation Scoring Algorithm** 📊  
   - Aggregate on-chain data to compute a weighted reputation score.  
   - Evaluate key factors such as wallet age, balance, transaction history, and interactions with decentralized protocols.  
   - Apply Sybil detection techniques to mitigate manipulation.

4. **Multi-Chain Support** 🌐  
   - Assess wallets across **Ethereum**, **BNB Chain**, **Polygon**, and other EVM-compatible networks.  
   - Plan for future expansion to non-EVM blockchains.
